# Revulo-Games

This was one of my first level designing attempts, with some extra scripts I wrote.

## Overall
I received an Unity Asset package called Tiki 2.5D.
My task was to create a level with given tools, and additional assets from Unity Asset Store or other sources.
Instead of creating one long level, I decided to create 10 scenes with a short levels on it. 
It still could work as a single scene with a usage of Player.Transform on each EndGoal.
I also added a few new scripts to add new game mechanics such as turning on/off different game objects.
In-Game mechanics are explaind via neon lights on each training level. After that, neon lights are used to troll player, or be a comic relief.
